  Alright, it’s time to start our presentation. We’re group 4 and will talk about private education in Korea.
 The number on the screen, can you imagine how massive this money(2.1 trillion won) is? Let me help you. You could not spend this up for your whole life even if you buy a Ferrari every week. So, what kind of business would make this amount of money?<p>
 Actually, this is the total cost spent for private education in Korea in 2019. Though this itself is a huge surprise, what is more serious is the gap between private and public education.<p>
 The national budget given to the Ministry of Education in 2019 is about 160 billion won.<p>So, apparently 130 times of the budget was spent in the private education market, 130 times!
 Then, do 'we' need to take this seriously about the situation? Definitely. It’s because, since public education is for everyone, what would happen because of this gap might come to me, you, or your family in the future. Therefore, you should act, you should not force the children to have private education //
 So, this is how our presentation will be. Reasons, actions, and followed by counterarguments. From now on, 한나 will introduce the reasons why we should not force the children to have private education.
